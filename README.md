# Project Goal and Idea

The main goal of the assignment was to create a sign up page with a responsive Hero Video in the header background, ineractive FAQ accordion and sign-up form.
This project is themed for nonprofit organization seeking to attract and sign up more volunteers for future events.
I had created a responsive webpage with the use of Flexbox approach. This time I decided to keep the design part simple and clean without any overload. This design looks ligt and natural on any screen view (mobile/tablet/desktop). 

## Tech Stack: JavaScript, CSS and html

## Cool Features
To ensure friendly User Inerface and provide greater User Experience following features were implemented:

- Hero video is live on any screen view and can be paused/played onclick.
- FAQ Accordion is ineractive and has a delicate slide down animation on it.
- Sign up form has some validations applied on every input field.
- Custom messages pops up if user types invalid details.
- Custom helping tips are visible under each input type when user focus(click) on the input field.
- Customized radio buttons and checkbox were created.
- Form can be cleared by clicking the Reset button.
